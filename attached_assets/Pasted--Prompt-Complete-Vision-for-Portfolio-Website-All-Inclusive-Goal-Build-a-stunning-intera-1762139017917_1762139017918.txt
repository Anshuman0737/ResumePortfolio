🧠 Prompt — Complete Vision for Portfolio Website (All Inclusive)

Goal:
Build a stunning, interactive, fully responsive personal + project portfolio website for Anshuman Pandey, showcasing his background, skills, education, experience, and projects — including a major flagship project: Afflatus RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation System).

🧩 1. Overall Concept

A galaxy-themed, black-purple luminescent design.

Hero section: animated and interactive — floating card with initials (“AP”) and name, glowing purple with particle galaxy background that responds to cursor movement and scroll.

As user scrolls, sections appear with GSAP / Framer Motion-style physics animations (smooth fades, slides, parallax).

Fully responsive (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Works directly on GitHub Pages or Replit hosting (no backend required).

Stack: HTML, CSS, JS, optionally with small GSAP or Three.js effects.

🪪 2. Hero Section (Lanyard Card Style)

Center floating “ID-card” style glass panel with glowing purple edges.

Shows:

Initials on top (“AP”)

Full name: Anshuman Pandey

Tagline: AI/ML Enthusiast • Full Stack Developer

Location: Bennett University • Noida, India

Buttons:

“Resume” → opens PDF

“Email” → mailto link

Smooth floating animation (subtle up-down movement).

Background: animated galaxy with stars, particles, or moving gradient.

Scroll indicator (e.g., ↓ icon) to hint scrolling to next sections.

🎓 3. Education Section

Bennett University, Noida

B.Tech – Computer Science (AI & Machine Learning specialization)

Duration, achievements, key coursework (e.g., Deep Learning, Full Stack Development, Data Structures).

Include logos or icons for institution and courses.

Add smooth slide-in animation from left.

💼 4. Experience Section

Main experiences (scroll-in cards):
